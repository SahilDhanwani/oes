OES - Online Examination System (An online examination system I made for my final year project)
Import oes.sql to your local databse server and run the Online_Examination_System_18s07034.jar file using command "java -jar Online_Examination_System_18s07034.jar".
If you want to make any changes access the coding by extracting the Online_Examination_System_18s07034.zip zip file.
Please note this is a project I made for my university, so please ignore the long naming conventions.
